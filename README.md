Hello! Thank you for checking out my Tic Tac Toe game. I built this program for the first project in my Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly. Running this program will allow you to play Tic Tac Toe on one screen. Feel free to play through the game by yourself, or against a friend if you have one in the room with you.

Below is a **list of technologies** I used to create this program:\
JavaScript\
HTML\
CSS\
AJAX\
jQuery\
Git\
GitHub\
GitHub Enterprise\
Heroku

You may or may not need to install some of these programs to properly interact with my program.

I wanted to make a game that will satisfy some of the following **user stories**:\
As a casual gamer, I want to play tic tac toe.\
As a serious gamer, I want to challenge my friends and find a platform where I can play other games.\
As a bored user, I want to have fun and kill time.\
As a developer, I want to inspect how the game functions (satisfied by comments in my code).\
As a possible future employer, I want to see clean UI and clean code (also satisfied by the comments in the code)\
As a frustrated user, I want the game to tell me whatâ€™s going wrong if I made an invalid move.\
As a happy/satisfied user, I want to be able to post my results to a social media site.\
As a happy/satisfied user, I want to be able to play another game.

Organization tools and **problem solving process**:

I used Trello to get all my thoughts organized and features planned out. I wanted to plan it all out and give myself instructions for each step. I utilized pseudocode to help convert my plain english/instructions into actual code. I like to collaborate so I worked with classmates through some basic/technical/setup steps.

A good example of one challenge I overcame was when I tried to do too much at once while working on the game logic. I built a conditional statement that had a few working win states. In the process of writing the rest of the win states, I got carried away and tried to incorporate a few different features at once. I ended up building a large jenga tower that collapsed in no time. I was left with a big plate of spaghetti code and had to backtrack/rewrite much of what I wrote. After this experience, I became much more diligent in writing clean and descriptive commit messages. While I was making a lot of commits up until this point, they were a bit random in nature. Some were small with no descriptions, and others were large with messages that did not fully encompass what I had changed. After cleaning up my Italian mess, my commits from then on became much more deliberate with clear messages so that other developers would be able to understand what I was doing after each commit.

List of **unsolved problems** to be fixed in future iterations:\
- My game does not create new games in the API, nor does it update the API with any moves.\
- At the moment, I have every profile feature visible at all times. Future iterations will be more user friendly and will only show relevant features at appropriate times.\
- I would also like to have my profile features on the left side of the screen, and have the game board on the right side of the screen (similar to my wireframe).
